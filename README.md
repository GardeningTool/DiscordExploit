How It Works

Discord's caching system downloads a file and caches it. Then, Windows Defender scans the file. The file has a script appended to it that Windows Defender flags as malware, and alerts everyone that downloaded it about it.

This may also work for various other services, such as Zoom, Steam, Microsoft Teams, etc.
